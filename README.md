## Code Examples

### Deploying AI Model with Docker
```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
This Dockerfile demonstrates how to containerize an AI model for deployment.

### Deploying AI Model with Kubernetes
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ai-model-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ai-model
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ai-model
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ai-model
        image: my-ai-model:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ai-model-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: ai-model
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```
This Kubernetes configuration demonstrates how to deploy an AI model as a service with multiple replicas.

### Deploying AI Model with GitHub Actions
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Build Docker image
      run: |
        docker build -t my-ai-model .
    - name: Push Docker image to registry
      run: |
        docker tag my-ai-model username/my-ai-model:latest
        docker push username/my-ai-model:latest
    - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
      run: |
        kubectl apply -f kubernetes-deployment.yaml
```
This GitHub Actions workflow demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline for building, pushing, and deploying an AI model.
